## led_blink

### Assignment Description
use vs code to make the onboard LED on the Rasberry Pi Pico blink.


### Evidence 
![Blink](https://github.com/cwyatt29/Cyrus_Wyatt_Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/images/LED%20BLINK.gif)
### Wiring
No wiring was needed because the Pico has an onboard LED which can blink.
### Code

[Code](https://github.com/cwyatt29/Cyrus_Wyatt_Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/LED_blink.py)
### Reflection
This assignment was very simple most of the command scripts we needed were in the instructions so all that was needed was to order them correctly and run the code. This code would be useful if you want to make sure your pico is functioning properly before launching a rocket or another flying projectile.




## LaunchPadPart1

### Assignment Description
Create a code that will print a countdown into the serial monitor. Code should start at 10 and stop at 0.


### Evidence 
![Countdown](https://github.com/cwyatt29/Cyrus_Wyatt_Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/images/Countdown%20GIf-min.gif)
### Wiring
No wiring was needed for this because it is only in a serial monitor
### Code

### Reflection
The command N -= 1 is used to minus one from the value of N every loop. This is useful to know because N - 1 will just print 9 and N = -1 will print -1. Other than that the code is simple. Also remember to use if N = 0 break which will prevent the code from going into negative values.

## LaunchPadPart2

### Assignment Description
Blink a red light each second of the countdown, and turn on a green LED to signify liftoff.

## Raspberry_Pi_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Evidence 

Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here. You need to communicate what your thing does. 

### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here. The diagram should be clear enough that I can recreate the wiring from scratch. 

### Code
[code]() **COMMENT YOUR CODE** if you want full credit. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
